<h2>👋 Hello! I'm Connor!</h2>

- 👨‍🎓 I am a member of Champlain College's Class of 2026 studying Computer Networking and Cybersecurity.
- 💼 I am also currently employed by Simpleroute as a Junior Solutions Engineer.
- 📝 I'm currently studying to achieve my Cisco CCNP Enterprise certification.
- 🦀 My favorite food is any type of whole crab I can pick apart, but creamed chipped beef is a close second!
